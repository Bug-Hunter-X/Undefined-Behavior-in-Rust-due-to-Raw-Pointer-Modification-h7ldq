This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Rust: using raw pointers to modify a vector after its length has changed.  Modifying a vector through a raw pointer after its capacity has been altered is dangerous and could lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior. This example highlights the importance of carefully managing memory and using safe Rust techniques whenever possible. The solution shows a safer approach.
